# NYC_CitiBike_Tableau_Challenge

## Overview

To convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal we are to use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

- Of the 2,344,224 riders, 81.07% are subscribers while 18.93% are customers. 
- There are almost 2.5x more male than female riders. 
- The peak time of most rides are between 8-9am and 5-6pm, which is during rush-hour when people are going and returning from work, respectively.
- The bike utilization exhibits that the bigger the bike is, the more it is used.

 ## Summary
 
 Since most of the rides are during the rush-hour times when subscribers and customers are going to and from work, it is ideal to have more bikes available at the most Trip Starting Locations. If there are schools around, it is suggestible to promote students to use CitiBikes by having some available outside of universities. Regular maintenance of the most used by trips bikes is vital for its durability. Additionally, having some data on tourist spots that have a lot of foot traffic would be another good place for distribution of bikes to enhance the profits.
